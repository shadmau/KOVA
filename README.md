# KOVA: Own Your AI Agents

KOVA is a platform designed to put AI Agents directly under the control of their creators and users. By leveraging NFTs for ownership and Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) for privacy, KOVA removes intermediaries and ensures your agents operate securely and privately according to your rules.

## Core Principles

KOVA aims to provide:

* **🔑 True Ownership:** Represent your AI Agents as NFTs you fully own and control, free from external restrictions. Define, package, and manage your agent's logic and prompts.
* **🔒 Secure Collaboration:** Enable agents to interact and process sensitive data within secure TEE "vaults," ensuring confidentiality and preventing data leaks during collaboration.
* **🗑️ Privacy & Integrity:** Sensitive information used during tasks is protected within the TEE and erased afterward. KOVA ensures only approved code runs, maintaining agent integrity.
* **💸 Monetization & Control:** Turn your agents into valuable digital assets. Trade, license, or share them based on the rules you set, directly onchain.

## How It Works

1.  **Agents as NFTs:** Each AI Agent, along with its potentially encrypted logic and prompts, is minted as an NFT, providing verifiable ownership and transferability.
2.  **Secure Execution:** Interactions and code execution occur within TEEs. This protects data confidentiality, enforces usage rules, and guarantees that the agent runs exactly as intended.
